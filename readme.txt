Tags: links, sidebar, widget
Requires at least: 2.8
Tested up to: 3.0
Stable tag: 0.3.5

This widget uses Javascript to dynamically expand or collapsable the set of
links for each link category.

== Description ==

This is a very simple plugin that uses Javascript to form a collapsable set of
links in the sidebar for the links (blogroll). Every link corresponding to a
given link category will be expanded.

You can use multiple instances of the widget, each with its own set of options. In this way you could have one set of links for certain categories one place on your page, and another widget with a different set of links somewhere else.

It is based off of the Collapsing Categories and Collapsing Pages plugins.

== Installation ==

IMPORTANT!
Please deactivate before upgrading, then re-activate the plugin.

Unpackage contents to wp-content/plugins/ so that the files are in a
collapsing-links directory. Activate the plugin in your Wordpress Admin
interface -- Collapsing Links. 

= MANUAL INSTALLATION = 

To use the plugin manually,
change the following here appropriate (most likely sidebar.php):

Change From:

    <ul>
     `<?php get_links_list(); ?>`
    </ul>

To something of the following:
`
    <?php
     if( function_exists('collapsLink') ) {
      collapsLink();
     } else {
      echo "<ul>\n";
      get_links_list();
      echo "</ul>\n";
     }
    ?>
`
You can add parameters to the collapsLink() function as described in the
options section.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

None yet.
   
== Screenshots ==

1. a few expanded links with default theme, showing multiple instances of the
widget
2. available options 

== Options ==
Style options can be set via the settings panel. All other options can be set
from the widget panel. If you wish to insert the code into your theme manually
instead of using a widget, you can use the following options. These options
can be given to the `collapsLink()` function either as an array or in query
style, in the same manner as the `wp_list_links` function.
`
  $defaults=array(
    'showLinkCount'=> true ,
    'catSort'=> 'linkName' ,
    'catSortOrder'=> 'ASC' ,
    'linkSort'=> 'linkName' ,

    'expand'=> 0 ,
    'customExpand' => '',
    'customCollapse' => '',
    'defaultExpand'=> '',
    'animate' => 0,
    'nofollow' => true,
    'debug' => false
  );

      this option if you are having problems

= Examples =

`collapsLink('animate=true&nofollow=false&expand=3,inExcludeCats=blogroll,lousy-friends')`
This will produce a list with:
* animation on
* no nofollow tags
* using images to mark collapsing and expanding
* exclude links in the categories blogroll and lousy-friends




== Demo ==

You can see this on my test blog at http://robfelty.com/test


== CAVEAT ==

Currently this plugin relies on Javascript to expand and collapse the links.
If a user's browser doesn't support javascript they won't see the links to the
posts, but the links to the links will still work (which is the default
behavior in wordpress anyways)

The option to show the number of links currently uses the number stored in the
database, which includes both visible and invisible links. If you have
invisible links, this number will be wrong.
